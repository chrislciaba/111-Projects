The included files are (other than this document) the Makefile containing
all of the desired implementation and the C program named lab1a.c. There
are no limitations regarding the program, however, it is important to note
that the status from the shell will print three different messages depending on
if it exited because of a signal, because the shell exited normally, or some
other abnormal behavior not caught previously. In order to view the exit code
of the parent process can be viewed with the command

echo $?

After the program runs. Also I'm not entirely sure why, but when I do the ls
command instead of printing everything in one line with spaces in between it
adds newlines between each of the files. Additionally, when hitting Ctrl-C and
after the exit command, the program needs an extra key to be pushed before it
exits.
